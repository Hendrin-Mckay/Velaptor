# **Raptor Release Notes**

## <span style="color:mediumseagreen;font-weight:bold">Version 0.20.1</span> - <span style="color:indianred;font-weight:bold">(Hot Fix)</span>

### **New** üéâ

1. Changed the window to be displayed in the center of the screen horizontally and vertically by default

### **Bug Fixes** üêû

1. Fixed an issue with the window position not working when using the `Window.Position` property

---

## <span style="color:mediumseagreen;font-weight:bold">Version 0.20.0</span>

### **New** üéâ

1. Added a method named `ShowAsync()` to the `IWindow` interface and all associated `IWindow` implementations
   * This is to provide the ability for consumers of the library/framework to create `IWindow` implementations, that can show the window asynchronously instead of on the applications main thread
   * Example: Showing a **Raptor** window inside of a GUI application like **WPF** or **WinForms**, and not block the UI thread

---

## <span style="color:mediumseagreen;font-weight:bold">Version 0.19.0</span>

### **Bug Fixes** üêû

1. Fixed an issue with an **OpenGL** bindings exception being thrown when using the `SpriteBatchFactory.CreateSpriteBatch()` method
   * This was due to something that was missed when implementing the change in release **v0.18.0**

### **Nuget/Library Updates** üì¶

1. Update nuget package **OpenTK** from **v4.0.6** to **v4.2.0**
2. Update nuget package **Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.FxCopAnalyzers** from **v3.3.0** to **v3.3.1**

---

## <span style="color:mediumseagreen;font-weight:bold">Version 0.18.0</span>

### **New** üéâ

1. Added a new method to the `Window` class named `ShowAsync()` to add the ability to run a **Raptor Window** on another thread
   * Currently `Show()` blocks the thread that it was invoked on due to the `Show()` method not returning until the window has been closed  This is not ideal due to how long the window needs to live.  Using `ShowAsync()` will allow the use of the window while still allowing execution after the invocation of the method
     * Use Case: Running a **Raptor Window** from a GUI application
   * Any implementation of the `Window` class will get this functionality

### **Bug Fixes** üêû

1. Fixed an issue with the abstract `Window` class not being disposed of properly when closing the window
2. Fixed an issue with the `Sound` class not being disposed of properly when calling dispose explicitly or implicitly

---

## <span style="color:mediumseagreen;font-weight:bold">Version 0.17.0</span>

### **Improvements** üåü

1. Improved how the `Window` class shows the window
   * Previously, the window was displayed on window creation before the `Show()` method was invoked.  Now the window will only be displayed when invoking the `Show()` method.  This gives more control over how the window is displayed during window creation and also enables better management of when a window is shown on another thread other than the **main thread**
   * NOTE: Simply invoking the `Show()` method on a worker thread will run the window on that thread

## <span style="color:mediumseagreen;font-weight:bold">Version 0.16.1</span> - <span style="color:indianred;font-weight:bold">(Hot Fix)</span>

### **Bug Fixes** üêû

1. Fixed an issue with failing unit tests related to unsafe pointer setup with the unit tests and implementation details related to **GLFW**

---

## <span style="color:mediumseagreen;font-weight:bold">Version 0.16.0</span>

### **New** üéâ

1. Added the ability for the abstract `Window` class to allow for automatic buffer clearing
   * Setting the `AutoClearBuffer` property to true will automatically clear the buffer before rendering
   * If the `AutoClearBuffer` property is set to false, the buffer has to be cleared manually.  This can be done by using the `SpriteBatch.Clear()` method

### **Breaking Changes** üí£

1. Moved the following types to to a new namespace with the name `Raptor.Desktop`
   * `IWindow`
   * `Window`
2. Added 2 more new interfaces related to window properties for window state and actions
   * Added new interfaces called `IWindowProps` and `IWindowActions`
   * These interfaces were added to the `Raptor.Desktop` namespace
3. Changed the name of the `Window.UpdateFreq` property to `Window.UpdateFrequency`

### **Bug Fixes** üêû

1. Fixed a bug where the buffer was not being cleared before textures were being rendered
   * This was causing textures to be smeared on the render target during texture movement or animation
2. Fixed a bug where textures being rendered would be stretched horizontally and vertically when resizing the window

### **Breaking Changes** üí£

1. Improved how content is used and managed

   * Created a `ILoader<T>` for **Raptor** content types below
     1. Graphics
     2. Sound
     3. Atlas Data
   * Created new `IContent` type.  Every content type created must inherit from this interface to be able to be loaded and managed as **content**.  The list below are the current types that have been changed to use the new `IContent` type
     1. `ITexture`
     2. `ISound`
     3. `IAtlasRegionRectangle`

### **New** üéâ
