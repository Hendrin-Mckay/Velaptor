1. Changed the <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>Sound </span> class to take in a full file path to the sound content instead of just a sound name
   * Before this used a content source to resolve where the sound content was located
   * The new <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>SoundLoader </span> is now responsible for resolving the path to the sound content before loading the sound
2. The following types have changed their names
   * <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>AtlasDataLoader </span> class name has been changed to <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>AtlasLoader</span>

## <span style="color:mediumseagreen;font-weight:bold">Version 0.21.0</span>

### **Breaking Changes** üí£

1. Changed <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>Keyboard </span> class from static to non static
   * Implemented new <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>IKeyboard </span> interface that the <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>Keyboard </span> class inherits from.  This makes the keyboard functionality much more testable and able to be injected using a DI container.
2. Changed <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>Mouse </span> class from static to non static
   * Implemented new <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>IMouse </span> interface that the <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>Mouse </span> class inherits from.  This makes the keyboard functionality much more testable and able to be injected using a DI container.
3. Changed the <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>contentLoader </span> parameter type from a concrete <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>ContentLoader </span> type, to the <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>IContentLoader </span> interface type for the <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>LoadContent() </span> method in the <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>IContentLoadable </span> interface
   * This is to follow along with the design of making things flexible and testable and aligns with the rest of the library

## <span style="color:mediumseagreen;font-weight:bold">Version 0.20.1</span> - <span style="color:indianred;font-weight:bold">(Hot Fix)</span>

### **New** üéâ

1. Changed the window to be displayed in the center of the screen horizontally and vertically by default

### **Bug Fixes** üêû

1. Fixed an issue with the window position not working when using the <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>Window.Position </span> property
2. Fixed an issue with **GLFW** exceptions being thrown when using a width or height value of **'0'** when using the <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>CreateWindow() </span> method in the <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>WindowFactory </span> class

---

## <span style="color:mediumseagreen;font-weight:bold">Version 0.20.0</span>

### **New** üéâ

1. Added a method named <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>ShowAsync() </span> to the <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>IWindow </span> interface and all associated <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>IWindow </span> implementations
   * This is to provide the ability for consumers of the library/framework to create <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>IWindow </span> implementations, that can show the window asynchronously instead of on the applications main thread
   * Example: Showing a **Raptor** window inside of a GUI application like **WPF** or **WinForms**, and not block the UI thread

---

## <span style="color:mediumseagreen;font-weight:bold">Version 0.19.0</span>

### **Bug Fixes** üêû

1. Fixed an issue with an **OpenGL** bindings exception being thrown when using the <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>SpriteBatchFactory.CreateSpriteBatch() </span> method
   * This was due to something that was missed when implementing the change in release **v0.18.0**

### **Nuget/Library Updates** üì¶

1. Updated nuget package **OpenTK** from **v4.0.6** to **v4.2.0**
2. Updated nuget package **Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.FxCopAnalyzers** from **v3.3.0** to **v3.3.1**

---

## <span style="color:mediumseagreen;font-weight:bold">Version 0.18.0</span>

### **New** üéâ

1. Added a new method to the <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>Window </span> class named <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>ShowAsync() </span> to add the ability to run a **Raptor Window** on another thread
   * Currently <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>Show() </span> blocks the thread that it was invoked on due to the <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>Show() </span> method not returning until the window has been closed  This is not ideal due to how long the window needs to live.  Using <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>ShowAsync() </span> will allow the use of the window while still allowing execution after the invocation of the method
     * Use Case: Running a **Raptor Window** from a GUI application
   * Any implementation of the <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>Window </span> class will get this functionality

### **Bug Fixes** üêû

1. Fixed an issue with the abstract <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>Window </span> class not being disposed of properly when closing the window
2. Fixed an issue with the <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>Sound </span> class not being disposed of properly when calling dispose explicitly or implicitly

---

## <span style="color:mediumseagreen;font-weight:bold">Version 0.17.0</span>

### **Changes** ‚ú®

1. Improved how the <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>Window </span> class shows the window
   * Previously, the window was displayed on window creation before the <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>Show() </span> method was invoked.  Now the window will only be displayed when invoking the <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>Show() </span> method.  This gives more control over how the window is displayed during window creation and also enables better management of when a window is shown on another thread other than the **main thread**
   * NOTE: Simply invoking the <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>Show() </span> method on a worker thread will run the window on that thread

---

## <span style="color:mediumseagreen;font-weight:bold">Version 0.16.1</span> - <span style="color:indianred;font-weight:bold">(Hot Fix)</span>

### **Bug Fixes** üêû

### **New** üéâ

1. Added the ability for the abstract <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>Window </span> class to allow for automatic buffer clearing
   * Setting the <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>AutoClearBuffer </span> property to true will automatically clear the buffer before rendering
   * If the <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>AutoClearBuffer </span> property is set to false, the buffer has to be cleared manually.  This can be done by using the <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>SpriteBatch.Clear() </span> method

### **Breaking Changes** üí£

1. Moved the following types to to a new namespace with the name <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>Raptor.Desktop`
   * <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>IWindow</span>
   * <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>Window</span>
2. Added 2 more new interfaces related to window properties for window state and actions
   * Added new interfaces called <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>IWindowProps </span> and <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>IWindowActions</span>
   * These interfaces were added to the <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>Raptor.Desktop </span> namespace
3. Changed the name of the <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>Window.UpdateFreq </span> property to <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>Window.UpdateFrequency</span>

### **Bug Fixes** üêû

1. Fixed a bug where the buffer was not being cleared before textures were being rendered
   * This was causing textures to be smeared on the render target during texture movement or animation
2. Fixed a bug where textures being rendered would be stretched horizontally and vertically when resizing the window

     1. <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>ITexture</span>
