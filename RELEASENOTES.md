# **Raptor Release Notes**

## <span style='color:mediumseagreen;font-weight:bold'>Version 0.27.0</span>

### **New** üéâ

1. Exposed internal struct type `SpriteBatchItem`
   * This was exposed just in case a library user wanted to use this
2. Added a new extension method named `MapValue` to the `byte` data type to allow the user to map a `byte` value to another range where the start and stop values of the range are of the type `float`

---

## <span style="color:mediumseagreen;font-weight:bold">Version 0.20.0</span>

### **New** üéâ

1. Added a method named <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>ShowAsync() </span> to the <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>IWindow </span> interface and all associated <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>IWindow </span> implementations
   * This is to provide the ability for consumers of the library/framework to create <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>IWindow </span> implementations, that can show the window asynchronously instead of on the applications main thread
   * Example: Showing a **Raptor** window inside of a GUI application like **WPF** or **WinForms**, and not block the UI thread

---

## <span style="color:mediumseagreen;font-weight:bold">Version 0.19.0</span>

### **Bug Fixes** üêõ

1. Fixed an issue with an **OpenGL** bindings exception being thrown when using the <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>SpriteBatchFactory.CreateSpriteBatch() </span> method

---

## <span style="color:mediumseagreen;font-weight:bold">Version 0.18.0</span>

### **New** üéâ

1. Added a new method to the <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>Window </span> class named <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>ShowAsync() </span> to add the ability to run a **Raptor Window** on another thread
   * Currently <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>Show() </span> blocks the thread that it was invoked on due to the <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>Show() </span> method not returning until the window has been closed  This is not ideal due to how long the window needs to live.  Using <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>ShowAsync() </span> will allow the use of the window while still allowing execution after the invocation of the method
     * Use Case: Running a **Raptor Window** from a GUI application
   * Any implementation of the <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>Window </span> class will get this functionality

### **Bug Fixes** üêõ

1. Fixed an issue with the abstract <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>Window </span> class not being disposed of properly when closing the window
2. Fixed an issue with the <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>Sound </span> class not being disposed of properly when calling dispose explicitly or implicitly

---

## <span style="color:mediumseagreen;font-weight:bold">Version 0.17.0</span>

### **Changes** ‚ú®

1. Improved how the <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>Window </span> class shows the window
   * Previously, the window was displayed on window creation before the <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>Show() </span> method was invoked.  Now the window will only be displayed when invoking the <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>Show() </span> method.  This gives more control over how the window is displayed during window creation and also enables better management of when a window is shown on another thread other than the **main thread**
   * NOTE: Simply invoking the <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>Show() </span> method on a worker thread will run the window on that thread

   * Setting the <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>AutoClearBuffer </span> property to true will automatically clear the buffer before rendering
   * If the <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>AutoClearBuffer </span> property is set to false, the buffer has to be cleared manually.  This can be done by using the <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>SpriteBatch.Clear() </span> method

### **Breaking Changes** üí£

1. Moved the following types to to a new namespace with the name <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>Raptor.Desktop`
