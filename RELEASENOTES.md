# **Raptor Release Notes**

## <span style="color:mediumseagreen;font-weight:bold">Version 0.23.1</span> - <span style="color:indianred;font-weight:bold">(Hot Fix)</span>

### **Bug Fixes** üêû

1. Fixed a bug where only the max of 2 textures could be rendered in a batch on the same texture
   * The max quad buffer data amount (batch size) of 2 was all that was getting alloted on the GPU.  This was throwing an exception when attempting to render more than 2 quads worth of buffer data

### **New** üéâ

1. Added the ability to the `SpriteBatch` class to be able to set a custom batch size amount
   * Doing this will dispose of the GPU buffers and shader programs and re-create them

1. Added new enumeration type named `TextureType` to represent the kind of texture
   * This can be represent the rendering of a whole texture or sub-texture
2. Added a new interface type named `IContentUnloadable`
   * This can be used to unload content
3. Added ability to throw a descriptive exception when attempting to render a texture with a width or height that is less than or equal to zero

---

## <span style="color:mediumseagreen;font-weight:bold">Version 0.22.0</span>

### **Breaking Changes** üí£

1. Changed the `Sound` class to take in a full file path to the sound content instead of just a sound name
   * Before this used a content source to resolve where the sound content was located
   * The new `SoundLoader` is now responsible for resolving the path to the sound content before loading the sound
2. The following types have changed their names
   * `AtlasDataLoader` class name has been changed to `AtlasLoader`
   * `IContentSource` class name has been changed to `IPathResolver`
   * `ContentSource` class name has been changed to `ContentPathResolver`

   * `CreateTextureAtlasLoader()`
   * `CreateSoundLoader()`
2. `ContentSource` types are now called `Resolvers` and have been improved.  The following resolvers have been created to help resolve paths to various pieces of content
   * `AtlasJSONDataPathResolver`
   * `AtlasTexturePathResolver`
   * `SoundPathResolver`
   * `TexturePathResolver`
5. Created a `PathResolverFactory` class to create instances of the different resolvers
6. Created new types for loading texture atlas data such as texture atlas images and atlas sub texture data
   * Created the following types to be used for loading of texture atlas's
      * `IAtlasData`
      * `AtlasData`
      * `AtlasRepository`
      * `AtlasSubTextureData`
9. Made `MapValue()` overloads public to the library API for library users to use
   * These extension methods can be used map a value from one range to another

---

## <span style="color:mediumseagreen;font-weight:bold">Version 0.21.0</span>

### **Breaking Changes** üí£

1. Changed `Keyboard` class from static to non static
   * Implemented new `IKeyboard` interface that the `Keyboard` class inherits from.  This makes the keyboard functionality much more testable and able to be injected using a DI container.
2. Changed `Mouse` class from static to non static
   * Implemented new `IMouse` interface that the `Mouse` class inherits from.  This makes the keyboard functionality much more testable and able to be injected using a DI container.
3. Changed the `contentLoader` parameter type from a concrete `ContentLoader` type, to the `IContentLoader` interface type for the `LoadContent()` method in the `IContentLoadable` interface
   * This is to follow along with the design of making things flexible and testable and aligns with the rest of the library

### **Build/Release Pipelines** üîÅ

## <span style="color:mediumseagreen;font-weight:bold">Version 0.20.1</span> - <span style="color:indianred;font-weight:bold">(Hot Fix)</span>

---

## <span style="color:mediumseagreen;font-weight:bold">Version 0.20.0</span>

### **New** üéâ

1. Added a method named `ShowAsync()` to the `IWindow` interface and all associated `IWindow` implementations
   * This is to provide the ability for consumers of the library/framework to create `IWindow` implementations, that can show the window asynchronously instead of on the applications main thread
   * Example: Showing a **Raptor** window inside of a GUI application like **WPF** or **WinForms**, and not block the UI thread

---

## <span style="color:mediumseagreen;font-weight:bold">Version 0.19.0</span>

### **Bug Fixes** üêû

1. Fixed an issue with an **OpenGL** bindings exception being thrown when using the `SpriteBatchFactory.CreateSpriteBatch()` method
   * This was due to something that was missed when implementing the change in release **v0.18.0**

### **Nuget/Library Updates** üì¶

1. Updated nuget package **OpenTK** from **v4.0.6** to **v4.2.0**
2. Updated nuget package **Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.FxCopAnalyzers** from **v3.3.0** to **v3.3.1**

---

## <span style="color:mediumseagreen;font-weight:bold">Version 0.18.0</span>

### **New** üéâ

1. Added a new method to the `Window` class named `ShowAsync()` to add the ability to run a **Raptor Window** on another thread
   * Currently `Show()` blocks the thread that it was invoked on due to the `Show()` method not returning until the window has been closed  This is not ideal due to how long the window needs to live.  Using `ShowAsync()` will allow the use of the window while still allowing execution after the invocation of the method
     * Use Case: Running a **Raptor Window** from a GUI application
   * Any implementation of the `Window` class will get this functionality

### **Bug Fixes** üêû

1. Fixed an issue with the abstract `Window` class not being disposed of properly when closing the window
2. Fixed an issue with the `Sound` class not being disposed of properly when calling dispose explicitly or implicitly

---

## <span style="color:mediumseagreen;font-weight:bold">Version 0.17.0</span>

### **Improvements** üåü

1. Improved how the `Window` class shows the window
   * Previously, the window was displayed on window creation before the `Show()` method was invoked.  Now the window will only be displayed when invoking the `Show()` method.  This gives more control over how the window is displayed during window creation and also enables better management of when a window is shown on another thread other than the **main thread**
   * NOTE: Simply invoking the `Show()` method on a worker thread will run the window on that thread

---

## <span style="color:mediumseagreen;font-weight:bold">Version 0.16.1</span> - <span style="color:indianred;font-weight:bold">(Hot Fix)</span>

### **Bug Fixes** üêû

1. Fixed an issue with failing unit tests related to unsafe pointer setup with the unit tests and implementation details related to **GLFW**

---

## <span style="color:mediumseagreen;font-weight:bold">Version 0.16.0</span>

### **New** üéâ

1. Added the ability for the abstract `Window` class to allow for automatic buffer clearing
   * Setting the `AutoClearBuffer` property to true will automatically clear the buffer before rendering
   * If the `AutoClearBuffer` property is set to false, the buffer has to be cleared manually.  This can be done by using the `SpriteBatch.Clear()` method

### **Breaking Changes** üí£

1. Moved the following types to to a new namespace with the name `Raptor.Desktop`
   * `IWindow`
   * `Window`
2. Added 2 more new interfaces related to window properties for window state and actions
   * Added new interfaces called `IWindowProps` and `IWindowActions`
   * These interfaces were added to the `Raptor.Desktop` namespace
3. Changed the name of the `Window.UpdateFreq` property to `Window.UpdateFrequency`

### **Bug Fixes** üêû

1. Fixed a bug where the buffer was not being cleared before textures were being rendered
   * This was causing textures to be smeared on the render target during texture movement or animation
2. Fixed a bug where textures being rendered would be stretched horizontally and vertically when resizing the window

---

## <span style="color:mediumseagreen;font-weight:bold">Version 0.15.0</span>

   * Created a `ILoader<T>` for **Raptor** content types below
     1. Graphics
     2. Sound
     3. Atlas Data
   * Created new `IContent` type.  Every content type created must inherit from this interface to be able to be loaded and managed as **content**.  The list below are the current types that have been changed to use the new `IContent` type
     1. `ITexture`
     2. `ISound`
     3. `IAtlasRegionRectangle`

### **New** üéâ

1. Created new `IPlatform` type with associated implementation type `Platform` to detect which platform the code is running on
